Assembly visualiser and debugger.

Ideas
1) x86/x64 interpreter
+ not dependent on local server
+ insight into app code
- lot of work, not everything would be emulated

2) "Stupid" visualising client + websocket client
+ uses existing infrastructure
- no insight into app code
- requires offline client

3) Integration into Devi
+ almost everything ready for inclusion
